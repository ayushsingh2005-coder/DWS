// space and time complexity

// TIME COMPLEXITY
// we can't  say !

// time_complexity != time taken by program to execute

// time complxity is the rate at which the time taken increases with respect to the input size

// T.C = represnted by BIG-O notation -->> O(time taken hypothetically )

// for(i=1 ; i<=5 ; i++){
//     cout << "hii";
// }

// O() = no. of steps this code takes

// the loop runs for 5 times 
// every time there are 3 operations performed :
// increment --> check --> print 

// T.C = O(5 ✖️ 3) = O(15)
// but this is a number ,we can't represent T.C in number 
// so for i<=N 
// the code will run  for N time 
// and the op. performed = 3
//  so the T.C = O(N ✖️ 3)

// 3 Rules to remembered while calculating Time complexity :
// 1.Always compute the T.C in worst case scenario
// 2.Avoid constant
// 3.avoid lower value

// SPACE COMPLEXITY
// it is defined as the sum of 

// AUXILLARY SPACE + INPUT SPACE 

// AUXILLARY SPACE : space that we take to solve the problem 
// INPUT SPACE : the space tha we take to store the input 

// I RULE : Never manipulate or temper the data unless and untill it is being told by the interviewer
